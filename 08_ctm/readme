REAEME
======

I didn't provide meteorology files in this package so as to speed-up internet transfer. 
You need to download below 4 meterology fields from NCEP-DOE reanalysis, so-called NCEP2, 
or NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, so-called NCEP1, from NOAA/ERSL website by using "wget" command:

wget ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis2/pressure/air.2010.nc
wget ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis2/pressure/omega.2010.nc
wget ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis2/pressure/uwnd.2010.nc
wget ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis2/pressure/vwnd.2010.nc

and then put those 4 files into "test1_watervapor" and "test2_gfed" directories.

Cheers!
